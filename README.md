  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>I am Rea Carolyn,  a freelance QA tester based in Santa Clara, CA. I love high quality websites and apps that are sleek-looking, organized, modern and minimal. I see bugs quickly because I am a perfectionist. My inspiration is my love of  interior design, home organizing and the art of photography. I also  love solving math problems and puzzles. </p>
  
<p>I enjoy hiking with my family of 5. We all  love exploring the outdoors, we are all foodies and we love to watch movies! We spend most of our weekends on the beach or strolling in the parks. </p>
  
<p>In my free time I enjoy  cooking and baking pastries, pies and breads for my family.</p>
    </p>
   <h2>MY JOURNEY</h2>
    <p>I am a scientist by profession. I am a very curious person, detail oriented and loves complexity. I love learning new skills all the time and during the pandemic, I decided that I wanted to learn how to code, and also how to test the quality of softwares while I am staying at homeschooling of my 3 kids. I started to become a freelancer QA tester and the rest is history.  </p>
